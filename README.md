# How to run
1. To initialize the database, go to `backend/reset_database` and run `go run .`
2. (Optional) [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), then [configure AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html). If you do not do this, all AWS calls will fail.
3. Go to the `backend` folder in PowerShell and run the command `go run .`
  - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to make sure it is working.
4. Go to the `app` folder, and install dependencies with `npm i`
5. Do `npm start` and wait for it to compile
6. With the backend server still running, go to http://localhost:3000/streetfoodlove/
  - Press ctrl-c to stop the server and npm

# To run in production

```
| home
|------cert.crt
|------cert.key
|------secrets.json
|------backend
```

1. As shown in the directory tree above, place the `.crt` and `.key` certificate files in the parent directory of `backend`.
2. Create a file named `secrets.json` with the schema given in `backend/database.Secrets`.
3. Clone just the `backend` directory to the same directory where the certificates are located.
  - Steps 3 to 4 are completed through AWS CodeDeploy using the [appspec.yml](/appspec.yml) file.
4. Run the `backend` package, passing the environment variable `SECRETS_FILE` containing the path to the `secrets.json` file. For example:
  ```
  SECRETS_FILE=~/secrets.json sudo -E go run .
  ```
