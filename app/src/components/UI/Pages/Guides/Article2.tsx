        to purchase it new or used. While there are advantages and disadvantages
        of each choice, it ultimately comes down to what your budget is and how
        much you can afford upfront. We'll go over the pros and cons of buying
        new and used food trucks, so you can make the best decision for your
        financial status.{" "}

      <h4>Buying a New Food Truck</h4>
      <p>
        If you have the money, buying a new food truck is a worthwhile
        investment that will help you avoid costly repairs down the line.
        Discover the advantages and disadvantages of buying a new food truck
        below.
      </p>
      <h4>New Food Truck Advantages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom-tailored to your needs</li>
        <li>No wear and tear or undisclosed damages</li>
        <li>Reduces the risk of costly breakdowns and major repairs</li>
        <li>Usually have great warranties</li>
        <li>Fresh, clean, and polished appearances</li>
        <li>New Food Truck Disadvantages</li>
        <li>Large financial investment</li>
        <li>Customization requires longer lead times</li>
        <li>
          High initial expense makes it hard to make future changes if you
          quickly outgrow the truck's capacity
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Buying a Used Food Truck</h4>
      <p>
        If you want to own your food truck but are hesitant to invest in a brand
        new vehicle, buying a used food truck is a great alternative. Learn
        about the advantages and disadvantages of buying a used food truck
        below.
      </p>
      <h4>Used Food Truck Advantages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Initially cheaper than new trucks</li>
        <li>
          Pre-done retrofitting allows you to see if the kitchen layout works
          for you
        </li>
        <li>Equipment is already installed</li>
        <li>Cuts the decision-making process down</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Used Food Truck Disadvantages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher risk of costly repairs and maintenance</li>
        <li>Unknown wear and tear</li>
        <li>Lower life expectancy</li>
        <li>
          You may have trouble finding a vendor willing to customize it-because
          they don't know what was done previously
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lease a Food Truck</h3>
      <p>
        Purchasing a kitchen-equipped truck is the most expensive part of
        becoming a food truck operator, so many entrepreneurs circumnavigate
        this major up-front cost by leasing their food truck. Making smaller
        payments over time allows you to get a brand new, high-end food truck
        without a large initial fee. The leasing route might be right for you if
        you're new to the foodservice industry or want to see if your brick and
        mortar does well as a food truck. One disadvantage of leasing a food
        truck is you may have to return the truck when your lease ends. If your
        food truck business is doing well, you'll endure a stressful transition
        to a new truck, lose operational time, or be forced to close your
        thriving business. We strongly recommend choosing a food truck lease
        agreement with lease renewal or lease-to-own options.

      <h3>Where To Buy a Food Truck</h3>
      <p>
        Once you know your budget and decide whether you want a new, used, or
        leased food truck, you'll need to find a reputable food truck dealer.
        While you can purchase food trucks from private parties and sites like
        Craigslist or eBay, it's important to recognize the high risk of this
        choice. When investing an immense sum of money into the foundation of
        your business, you want to know every detail about your future food
        truck.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website Food Truck Empire provides a list of reputable dealers and
        helps you find a dealer in your state. Also, many entrepreneurs ask the
        owner of their favorite food truck where they purchased their vehicle.
        Asking food truck owners for recommendations provides the opportunity to
        inquire about how well their truck runs and if they had a positive
        experience with its vendor.Additionally, we've created a list of
        reputable food truck manufactures below. These dealers offer a selective
        inventory of food trucks, and most offer leasing options. You can fully
        customize your food truck when purchasing from any of these sites.
      </p>
      <h3>Design Your Own Food Truck</h3>
      <p>
        Customizing your food truck is both the most stressful and most
        intriguing part of buying a food truck. If you go with a reputable
        manufacturer, they'll take most of the stress off your shoulders and
        bring your vision to life. Founder of Prestige Food Trucks, Jeremy
        Adams, provided some great insight on how a typical purchasing process
        goes. While a lot more communication goes into the purchase than what is
        listed below, these five steps provide a general outline of the process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A customer will call or email the company they want to purchase from
          with an inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The customer receives a response that typically asks them what their
          equipment needs, and budget are, what city they'll be operating in,
          and what type of food they'll be serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once this information is provided, a company will usually send out
          custom blueprint options to which customers can make any adjustments.
        </li>
        <li>
          After this is completed, a company typically works on a 2-3-month lead
          time before shipping the food truck. Many manufacturers can ship
          nationally or internationally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a customer receives their purchase, they must obtain any permits
          needed before they can hit the streets selling their specialty
          cuisine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Customize a Food Truck</h3>
      <p>
        The main determining factor in how you should layout of your food truck
        is the cuisine you're offering. While the most common food truck items
        are flat grills, countertop fryers, food warmers, refrigerators, and
        freezers, each truck will differ. For example, a food truck specializing
        in pizza needs a pizza oven and possibly an extra generator or propane
        tank, whereas a coffee truck benefits from an extra supply of hot water.
        Also, as you customize your food truck to your menu, make sure your
        layout provides enough space for other pieces of essential food truck
        equipment.
      </p>
      <h4>Food Truck Size</h4>
      <p>
        The average food truck is 16 feet long and seven feet wide, but they can
        range from 10 to 26 feet long depending on their operational needs. Make
        sure you choose a vehicle that's large enough to accommodate your
        kitchen layout, ingredient storage requirements, and staff members.
        After assessing your needs, decide whether your mobile food business
        requires a food truck, food trailer, or a food cart. Some companies can
        transform anything, from step van chassis and sprinter vans to passenger
        vans and RVs, into fully functioning food trucks.
      </p>
      <h4>Food Truck Fuel</h4>
      <p>
        Decide whether you want to go with a gas or diesel engine for your food
        truck. There are many pros and cons to each type, so it comes down to
        preference. Most food truck owners choose diesel engines for their
        power, but you have to be prepared for that slightly larger initial
        investment.While gasoline is cheaper than diesel fuel, diesel has a
        greater fuel economy. Gas engines will run more quietly and have a less
        noticeable odor, whereas diesel engines provide you with unmatched
        power. If properly maintained, a diesel engine can easily go for 300,000
        miles. When engines require maintenance, gas operating engines are
        typically cheaper to repair than diesel. However, since diesel engines
        last longer, you'll get a better resale price if you ever decide to sell
        your food truck.
      </p>
      <h4>Food Truck Power Supply</h4>
      <p>
        Portable diesel generators are the typical power source for food trucks
        and trailers. Diesel-powered generators withstand constant heavy use and
        have long lifespans. If you live in a sunny location, you can
        sustainably power your food truck by installing solar panels to the
        roof. Another food truck power supply option is to use Liquefied
        Petroleum Gas cylinders.
      </p>
      <h4>Food Truck Special Features</h4>
      <p>
        Finally, when customizing your food truck, you get to pick the special
        features that will make it your own unique restaurant on wheels. Whether
        you're adding special equipment to the interior of the truck to make
        food prep more efficient, or you're adding aesthetic details to the
        exterior to make your truck more visually appealing to customers, a
        reputable dealer will work with your vision. Check out some beneficial
        accessories you can add to your truck below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Security Awning</em>-This locking security awning will protect the
        contents of your food truck when it's not in use. Security awnings are
        usually a sliding piece that covers windows, doors, and any external
        TVs, speakers, or other devices to protect them from vandalism. Use the
        awning as an extra branding space by customizing it to match your
        truck's design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Flat Panel TV </em>- Add a flat panel television to the exterior of
        your food truck so you can market your menu, specials, locations, and
        other important information. You can also use it to play music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Speakers</em> - By adding speakers, you can announce when orders are
        ready and entertain your long line of customers with music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Retractable Awning</em> - Manual or electric awnings shelter
        customers while they wait at your serving window and create a slight
        sound barrier that allows workers to hear customers' orders more
        clearly. Longer awnings protect patrons from the rain, snow, or glaring
        sun while they're waiting to order, which prevents lost business due to
        long, uncomfortable wait times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Misting System</em> - This feature is perfect for the summer months
        or for food trucks in areas where the climate is hot year-round. Food
        truck operators usually install misting systems above their exterior
        serving window to keep customers cool while they wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Vinyl Wrap</em> - Many businesses have designers who work with
        clients to create a personal logo or image. They then transfer the logo
        onto a vinyl wrapping that goes around the entire truck for branding.
        These wrappings can include graphics, menus, business names, and any
        other advertising materials, and they will include the proper cutouts
        for windows and serving windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perforated Window Film</em>- Window perforation allows your logo or
        decal to continue onto the exterior of your windows. This allows
        customers to see the image, but also enables employees to still see
        clearly out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Dual-Service </em>- Many truck owners want to have service stations
        on both sides of the truck so they can maximize volume and service.
