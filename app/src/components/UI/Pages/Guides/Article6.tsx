      <Header as="h2">Steps to start a hot dog cart business</Header>
      <p>
        A hot dog cart business is one of the most lucrative enterprises to
        undertake since it's based on retailing a basic human necessity: food.
        Fairly simple to start from the ground up, flexible and not too cost
        demanding, this type of business also comes with the advantage of being
        mobile, allowing you to move between locations and target the best areas
        in terms of competition and demand.As easy as it may sound, you should
        also know that there are no shortcuts to success. Enthusiasm is vital
        when starting a new business but so is planning. So the first thing you
        should do to ensure your venture will succeed, even before making a
        financial commitment, is to research the basics.
      </p>
      <p>The Basics of a Hot Dog Cart Business</p>
      <h3>1. Legal Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        As with any type of business, hot dog vending has its specific legal
        requirements and constraints. These often vary by city, county and
        state, and you can learn about the ones that apply in your area by
        contacting your local Health Department or the Department of
        Environmental Services.
      </p>
      <p>At this stage, you'll address issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The street food vending regulations in your city</li>
        <li>
          The types of food you'll be selling and how they're handled, stored,
          thawed, and cooked
        </li>
        <li>
          Commissary requirements-the requirement to operate from a licensed
          commercial kitchen*
        </li>
        <li>The size, make and the equipment of the hot dog vending cart</li>
        <li>The cart's fresh water and wastewater holding capacity.</li>
        <li>Safe food handling course requirement.</li>
        <li>Hygiene policies.</li>
        <li>Pre-approval inspection of the equipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        * Most municipalities don't allow hot dog vendors to operate a food
        service business from a residential kitchen and they require the use of
        a commissary-a licensed and inspected commercial kitchen. Vendors must
        report to the commissary each day of operation to prepare the food that
        will be served from the cart and to clean the cart's equipment at the
        end of the day.After learning about the health and safety requirements,
        you should contact the Business License Department, since you'll most
        likely need a business license to operate your hot dog cart. You may
        also have to check the signage regulations in your area and see if
        there's a limit on the maximum amount of signage you are allowed to use.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Research Target Market and Locations</h3>
      <p>
        The food industry gathers, by default, a wide range of available
        customers. So your target market can't be restricted to just a group of
        people, since it potentially includes all those eating out or in search
        of a quick bite.
      </p>
      <p>You could sell your hot dogs to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Students</li>
        <li>Office Workers</li>
        <li>Businesspeople</li>
        <li>Tourists</li>
        <li>Concert goers</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>Everyone who resides in your target locations-see below.
      <p>Some possible locations are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>University campuses</li>
        <li>Business districts</li>
        <li>Industrial parks</li>
        <li>Touristic locations</li>
        <li>Stadiums and sport centers</li>
        <li>Farmers markets</li>
        <li>Construction sites</li>
        <li>Parking lots</li>
        <li>Outside bars.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Research Your Competition</h3>
      <p>
        Most people are not patient enough to research all the aspects of their
        future business. But sizing up the competition is the research step that
        separates those that are truly serious about their goals from the
        others. As such, you should take the time to make a list with the street
        food and hot dog vendors from your area and then visit as many as
        possible. This will give you the opportunity to see how your competition
        is operating and to find those things you'll want to implement or to
        avoid in your future business.
      </p>
      <p>For example, you could learn about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vendor's attitude</li>
        <li>
          What kinds of ingredients, condiments and toppings they're using?
        </li>
        <li>Food preparation and handling</li>
        <li>Unique recipes</li>
        <li>Marketing and branding</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Write Your Hot Dog Business Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The next step is to write a business plan that covers your company's
        structure, your product, you're the target market, your personnel, the
        marketing plan, competitive analysis, cash flow analysis-initial
        investment and start-up costs, and financial projections. Obviously, the
        more accurate the better, your success depends on it.
      </p>
      <p>Your business plan should look something like this:</p>
      <h4>Budget</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal expenses for obtaining licenses and permits</li>
        <li>Hot Dog Vending Cart price</li>
        <li>
          Insurance such as general liability, workers' compensation if
          applicable
        </li>
        <li>
          Operational cost for the first 1-2 months salaries of employees if
          any, bills and fees
        </li>
        <li>Initial stock costs: 1-2 months</li>
        <li>
          Incidental costs such as napkins, foil, sanitizer, ice, propane, etc{" "}
        </li>
        <li>Marketing promotion expenses.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Marketing Strategy and Sales Strategy</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Throw an opening party to let locals know you're open for business
        </li>
        <li>Engage in community events to sell your products</li>
        <li>
          Advertise your products in community-based newspapers, local TV and
          radio stations
        </li>
        <li>List your business on local and directories</li>
        <li>Leverage the power of internet and social media</li>
        <li>Engage in direct marketing and sales</li>
        <li>Encourage the use of Word-of-Mouth marketing</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Sales Forecast Template</h4>
      <p>50 hot dogs a day -approx. 30 people</p>
      <ul>
        <li>50 x $… = $… hot dogs</li>
        <li>50 x $… = $… soda or water</li>
        <li>20 x $… = $… chips or snacks</li>
        <li>Gross daily income = $…</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em>To calculate the approximate net profit, deduct a 30-35%
        cost ratio from gross sales.
      </p>
      <h4>5. Find Your Differentiators</h4>
      <p>
        The exciting part of starting your own hot dog cart business is in
        defining your concept and designing your menu. Although you'll want to
        stand out, you should keep your menu simple, especially in the
        beginning. This way, you'll have more time to prepare your products,
        less inventory to manage, and less waste of goods that aren't selling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose the buns and the hot dogs/sausages you'll sell carefully: they
        are the foundation of your business and the ones that will make or break
        your success. Before deciding, you should ask your family and friends to
        help you with a blind taste test.
      </p>
      <p>Remember, if you want to be the best, you have to sell the best.</p>
      <p>
        Quality is a great differentiator, but so is uniqueness. Since hot dogs
        are easy to customize, with the right toppings and condiments, finding a
        combination that's both delicious and unique to you shouldn't be
        difficult. You may also consider offering vegetarian and gluten-free
        options, to ensure you're covering as many options as possible. The
        bottom line is, the tastier your hot dogs are, the more customers you'll
        attract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget to offer drinks and sides as well. Pair your hot dogs with
        crispy chips, tasty fries and refreshing beverages. Since these products
        have higher profit margins than hot dogs, find a way to encourage
        customers to order them, such as daily deals or combos discounts.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Final Words of Advice</h3>
      <p>
        Always endeavor to upsell your customers on additional items. If they
        demand for a hot dog, you can also ask them if they would like a
        beverage also. Maintain a strict standard in personal hygiene. Customers
        don't joke with their health and cleanliness is one thing they will
        watch out for. Immediately you have secured a location or geographical
        area you intend to cover, start spreading the word about your business
        and a good way to go about this is to hand out some free sample of your
        hot dogs to key people like managers or foremen and hope that they will
        inform their staff concerning you. You can always use the aroma of your
        hot dog as a strategy to attract customers to your stand. So, ensure
        that you always have hot dogs cooking and their aroma will grab people's
        attention and encourage them to buy. Build and maintain good
        relationship with your customers. Get to know their names and reward the
        loyal customers with freebies.
