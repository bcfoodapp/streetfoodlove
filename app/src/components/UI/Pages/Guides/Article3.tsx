        <p>
          The amount of work required to open a bricks and mortar restaurant of
          your own can be daunting, especially if you have no prior experience
          in the food industry. However, a food truck could be the perfect entry
          point into the world of catering. New food truck operators are opening
          businesses all the time, and the industry itself is currently worth an
          estimated $1.2 billion - so now could be the time to launch your new
          venture.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help make your food dreams a reality, we're taking an in-depth look
          at the costs involved with starting a food truck.
        </p>
        <h3>Writing a business plan</h3>
        <p>
          More often than not, money is the main thing holding entrepreneurs
          back from following their ambitions. As a new business owner, the
          first step in is to write a business plan. This should focus on your
          financial forecasting, covering your initial funding requirements, a
          close look at the predicted food truck costs and how you believe your
          business will grow in its first few years. The more research you do in
          the initial stages and the more thorough your research is, the easier
          it should be for you to get your business up and running. You can get
          a better idea of how much money you'll need to start your food truck
          business by using our custom startup cost calculator
        </p>
        <p>
          please note these costs are indicative, and you can alter the figures
          for your own requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>Resources and equipment</h3>
        <p>
          Your main expense will be the food truck itself - prices range
          considerably when it comes to buying one of these specialist vehicles.
          At the low end of the scale, you could be looking at spending around
          $50,000, however, prices can go a lot higher for a new food truck,
          especially ones which are fully equipped and decorated.
        </p>
        <p>Other costs you'll need to factor in include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insurance - $2,000 to $4,000 per year</li>
          <li>Initial food costs and inventory - $1,000 to $2,000</li>
          <li>Uniforms - $0 to $1,000</li>
          <li>
            Paper products such as napkins, plates and so on- $200 to $300
          </li>
          <li>Website - $0 to $5,000</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hiring a team and finding vendors</h3>
        <p>
          One of the benefits of owning your own food truck is that they only
          need a couple of people to make them work. So, if you're planning on
          working in the truck yourself, you'll only need one, or possibly two,
          employees. The average wages you can expect to pay your staff will
          vary from state to state:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>minimum wage in Washington state - $14.49 per hour</li>
          <li>
            Average wage for a food truck manager in Washington state - $28.56
            per hour
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As well as staff, you'll need to source reliable vendors if your food
          truck startup is going to be a success. When looking at the price of
          ingredients, remember that you'll be marking up by around 300%, so you
          will need to think about your profit and loss here.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting your paperwork in order</h3>
        <p>
          Paperwork is an important part of launching any new business. Even
          though your food truck will be mobile, you'll still need a number of
          permits and licenses before you can begin trading. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employer Identification Number</li>
          <li>Business License</li>
          <li>Vehicle License</li>
          <li>Seller's Permit-some states only</li>
          <li>Food Safety/Food Handler's Permit</li>
          <li>Health Department Permit</li>
          <li>Fire Certificate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Choosing the right payment solution for your business</h3>
        <p>
          In general, consumers who use food trucks want to be served as quickly
          as possible. Most customers will also appreciate the ability to pay
          using a variety of methods. This means you'll need to invest in a
          point-of-sale system that can process payments quickly and
          efficiently, and that accepts all common payment methods.The cost of
          your POS system will vary depending on the package you choose. While
          some providers ask for a flat fee, others optimize each transaction
          based on a variety of factors.
        </p>
        <h3>Invest in marketing</h3>
        <p>
          Although a lot of entrepreneurs invest heavily in marketing, there are
          a lot of ways to keep these costs down. Many food truck owners make
          use of social media which can be an incredibly effective marketing
          tool, and a fantastic way to get your brand name out there and bring
          people to your business.
        </p>
        <p>These are just a few ways to attract customers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post menu items and appetizing content</li>
          <li>Free or inexpensive advertisements</li>
          <li>Offer incentives / discount codes to connect with you</li>
          <li>Partner up with other food trucks in your area</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Food truck stats</h3>
        <p>
          Between 2007 and 2012, the food truck industry grew at an average rate
          of 8.4% per year. In general, it costs between $28,000 and $114,000 to
          get a food truck business up and running, with the average food truck
          earning around $300,000 per year.Starting your own business is
          incredibly rewarding, especially if it's a success. The most important
          part of starting any new business is getting your financial
          forecasting right. Make sure your costs breakdown is as accurate as
          possible to ensure there are no surprises along the way.
