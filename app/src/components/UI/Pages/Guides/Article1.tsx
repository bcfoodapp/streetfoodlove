      <p>
        The timing could not be better: it seems that the street food craze is
        sweeping the world. From bustling cities to small towns, food on wheels
        is a growing trend. And it is not just drawing street food fans, it is
        bringing in big bucks too: according to Intuit, the street-food
        business, including food trucks and mobile food carts, is a $2.7 billion
        industry that has seen a 12.4% growth in the last 5 years alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        Traders are encouraged by the growing number of urban street markets,
        private events and street food festivals, while the entire trend is
        supported by the global rise of the foodie culture, making the public
        increasingly open to new taste experiences and quality cuisine.
      </p>
      <h3>The most popular street foods?</h3>
      <p>
        There are the classics:
        <em>hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream and doughnuts.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there are those inspired by ethnic cuisines such as tacos,
        empanadas, sushi and crepes. The possibilities are endless and it is up
        to you, the entrepreneur, to find the dishes and recipes that will set
        you apart from the rest and, most importantly, that will help you build
        a good reputation and a loyal customer base. But, before you decide what
        foods you are going to sell, you will have to consider: The PROs and
        CONs of a Food Cart Business.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many advantages to starting your own food cart business, which
        is why a lot of people choose to do just that. The PROs include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low start-up costs</li>
        <li>Less risky than opening up a restaurant</li>
        <li>The ability to be your own boss</li>
        <li>The flexibility to work when and where you want</li>
        <li>Little restaurant experience required</li>
        <li>The growing popularity of the street food trend</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But, as with all business endeavors, there are also CONs to examine. A
        food cart business is no walk in the park: there is a lot of hard work
        to be done and you will only see significant profits after your business
        picks up.
      </p>
      <p>The biggest CONs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being self-employed can be testing for some</li>
        <li>Long hours, early mornings and night shifts required</li>
        <li>Fierce competition</li>
        <li>There are many regulations and laws to comply with</li>
        <li>Seasonal reliance</li>
        <li>Finding a suitable location that you are allowed to trade in</li>
        <li>Customer service can be challenging if you are a solo-primeur</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From our experience as food carts manufacturers, people are attracted by
        affordable start-up costs and by flexibility; at the same time, the most
        common complaints-at least in the initial phase-are long working hours
        and industry volatility in terms of trends and business opportunities.
        However, if you are passionate about good food and you start with solid
        and well-researched plan, there is every chance you could make a roaring
        success of your food cart start-up.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1: Market Research</h3>
      <p>
        Market research involves finding out the who, what, where, why and when
        of your business, and while it is not the most exciting part of your
        endeavor, it is certainly an essential one. It can be risky and even
        silly to assume that you already know the answers to these questions and
        then get caught out later on.
      </p>
      <p>Here is what you need to address at this stage:</p>
      <h4>Operational</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Where will you set up your food cart business?</li>
        <li>When will you open to ensure the best business?</li>
        <li>How will the weather affect your trade?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Target Market</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Who are your customers? What is their demographic?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Competition</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there any competition? What do they offer? </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Locations and Business Opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        Finding a couple of great locations will play a major factor in your
        success and it depends on several key factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where you are allowed to park by law</li>
        <li>Where the customers are</li>
        <li>The prime hours for each location</li>
        <li>Competition</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some great places and opportunities to consider for trading are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Office parks</li>
        <li>The business districts</li>
        <li>Empty lots</li>
        <li>Shopping districts or malls</li>
        <li>Popular tourist locations</li>
        <li>Sports venues</li>
        <li>Parks and beaches</li>
        <li>Bus and train stations</li>
        <li>College campuses</li>
        <li>Festivals and events</li>
        <li>Conferences and conventions</li>
        <li>Private events such as weddings, birthdays and so on</li>
        <li>Corporate events</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of these locations will require permits and/or owner agreements, so
        make sure to check with your local authorities and institutions
        beforehand. When it comes to festivals, events, conferences and
        conventions the best thing to do is to get in touch with organizers and
        lease your space well in advance.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Determining Your Food Cart Business Legal Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        You have probably noticed that most How-To guides on this subject place
        sorting out the legal requirements at the bottom of their To-Do list.And
        here is why: the permits and licensing requirements for food cart
        businesses vary from country to country, state to state, and even city
        to city, so making a definitive list with everything you need is close
        to impossible.Only your local Health Department can provide you with the
        information that applies in your case.
      </p>
      <p>At this stage, you will address issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The street food vending regulations in your city</li>
        <li>Licenses and permits required</li>
        <li>
          The types of food you will be selling and how they are handled,
          stored, thawed, and cooked
        </li>
        <li>
          Commissary requirements-the requirement to operate from a licensed
          commercial kitchen
        </li>
        <li>The size, make and the equipment of your street food vehicle</li>
        <li>The vehicle is fresh water and wastewater holding capacity</li>
        <li>Safe food handling course requirement</li>
        <li>Hygiene policies</li>
        <li>Pre-approval inspection of the equipment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most municipalities do not allow food vendors to operate a food cart
        business from a residential kitchen and they require the use of a
        commissary-a licensed and inspected commercial kitchen. Vendors have to
        report to the commissary each day of operation to prepare the food that
        will be served from the cart and to clean the vehicles equipment at the
        end of the day. If you are selling prepackaged foods, you are not
        considered a food handler and may have less stringent requirements than
        if you are actually preparing foods or even scooping ice cream. But as
        long as food is unwrapped, you are typically considered to be a food
        handler and must meet specific regulations.While your cart or truck
        manufacturer will not know the nuances of each citys requirements, they
        can usually help you meet specific health standards. For example, all of
        our food carts are manufactured using food-grade materials for
        countertops and other parts/areas where food may be stored and
        prepared.In addition, we work closely with each of our clients to adapt
        the carts cooking and water systems so they will meet all the health and
        safety standards specific to the vendors area.Getting all the trading,
        health and safety qualifications in order will not only allow you to
        operate legally and avoid hefty fines, but it will also help enforce the
        publics hard-earned perception that that those running a street food
        business are doing their utmost to meet and surpass sanitary
        requirements. Basically, your legal status and reputation are on the
        line.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the food service permits and health requirements, you may
        also need to apply for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business license</li>
        <li>State sales tax permit</li>
        <li>Truck/cart registration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To sort these out, the city hall or the county clerks office will
        usually point you in the right direction.Keep in mind that before you
        can hit the road, health inspectors will check your vehicle. Usually,
        they look for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Proof of ownership, proper identification and license of the vehicle
        </li>
        <li>Proof of District-issued Food Manager Identification Card</li>
        <li>Food-purchase record storage and record keeping</li>
        <li>
          That your depot, commissary or service support facility meets your
          vending unit operation needs
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy of license for the service support facility and/or a recent
          inspection report
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Food vehicles are typically inspected at least once a year by a health
        department inspector, sometimes randomly.The inspector checks to see how
        food is stored so that it does not spoil and that it is kept at the
        proper temperature. All food equipment as well as sinks and water
        supplies are checked.Commercial kitchens and garages in which food
        vehicles are kept are also inspected frequently and can be given high
        fines if they do not meet health and fire codes. Some have been shut
        down because of too many violations. Likewise, trucks and carts have
        lost their licenses over repeated violations.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Choosing Your Street Food Business Platform/Vehicle</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile street food businesses come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and
        deciding which is the right one for you depends on your:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start-up budget</li>
        <li>Time commitment</li>
        <li>Vision and the ability to fulfill it</li>
        <li>Experience at running a business</li>
        <li>Target demographic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your options are food stands, food carts, concession trailers and food
        trucks. Each of them has its own unique benefits as well as some
        disadvantages:
      </p>
      <h4>Food Stands</h4>
      <p>
        Food stands are essentially booths or stalls that are either temporary
        or mobile are used to sell everything from quick snacks such as bagels,
        pretzels, and ice cream, to more elaborate meals. Most food stands are
        usually operated indoors, and they are an excellent choice in areas
        where outdoor selling is limited by cold or unpleasant weather.
      </p>
      <p>Pros: low start-up and running costs, flexibility.</p>
      <p>Cons: limited trading areas, limited inventory.</p>
      <h4>Food Carts</h4>
      <p>
        Food carts have been around for decades, and they are one of the most
        cost-effective ways to start a mobile food business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pros: affordable, easy to customize, easy to move between locations,
        easy to park, easy to maintain, suitable for both indoor and outdoor
        use, may require less licensing than a food truck.
      </p>
      <p>Cons: not too much space for preparing elaborate dishes.</p>
      <h4>Concession Trailers</h4>
      <p>
        Same as food carts, concession trailers have been around for a long time
        and are often found at fairs, carnivals and sporting events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pros: low overhead costs compared to food trucks, more space for
        cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cons: more difficult to move between locations, require bigger parking
        space both on/off-duty, involve higher operating costs.
      </p>
      <h4>Food Trucks</h4>
      <p>
        Very popular among seasoned street food vendors, food trucks can carry
        more food and handle more business than vending carts and concession
        trailers, but they also involve much higher start-up and running costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pros: more room for cooking and storing food which allows for more items
        on the menu, higher profits, increased mobility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cons: high start-up and running costs, require more maintenance than
        food carts, bigger parking space both on/off-duty, more licensing than a
        food cart.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Choosing Your Concept, Menu and Suppliers</h3>
      <p>
        Today, most street food vendors do not actually sell food-they sell a
        concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether they are food carts, concession trailers or food trucks, most
        successful street food businesses out there have themes or concepts that
        are consistently reflected in all their elements: exterior design,
        branding, menus and recipes.Your concept should be a means of
        distinguishing you from your competition and building your niche market.
        And, if you get it right, it can even draw media attention to your
        business.This brings us to menu planning. Choosing what kind of food you
        willl prepare and sell can be a fun task, and if you look at the carts,
        trailers and trucks operating on the streets, you will find that almost
        anything edible can be served as street food.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to menu
        planning, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What foods do you know how to cook?</li>
        <li>What foods do you enjoy cooking?</li>
        <li>What are the most popular foods in your area?</li>
        <li>
          What foods can you prepare relatively fast, repeatedly and without
          difficulty?
        </li>
        <li>What foods could your customers take with them easily?</li>
        <li>What foods have a good profit margin?</li>
        <li>What times of day will you be open for business?</li>
        <li>What are you going to specialize in?</li>
        <li>How many items will your menu have?</li>
        <li>Where are you going to get the ingredients from?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After deciding on the type of food you are going to sell, it is time to
        start working on recipes and experiment with various ingredients. Once
        you have found a few favorites, test them on your friends and family
        first. Do not be afraid or dismissive of criticism: it is better to
        receive it from them. The bottom line is, do not start out with foods
        you have not thoroughly tested. This means you need to perfect each
        recipe to be sure it has the following qualities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It tastes consistently good</li>
        <li>It is easy to make repeatedly in large quantities.</li>
        <li>It is easy to serve</li>
        <li>It is easy to store and carry</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Next in line is figuring out your sourcing-where will you buy your
        ingredients from?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sourcing your food can be an important factor in planning your
        purchases, schedule and menu items. Common sources include wholesale
        food distributors, food manufacturers, local and regional suppliers,
        green markets and farmers markets.Determining the right quantities is
        another matter that you will need to deal with, initially by trial and
        error. If you have the time, spend a couple of hours observing the
        street food vendors in your area. How many customers do they have per
        hour? When is their busiest period? This will help you estimate a
        potential sales volume, which you can use to draft your shopping list.
        Pay special attention to foods and ingredients that lose their freshness
        quickly; learn which are the items you can safely keep throughout the
        day and how many of them you can sell before they go bad.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Creating Your Food Cart Business Plan</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the low start-up costs involved, jumping into street food
        without any kind of plan is a sure-fire recipe for disaster. The space
        is extremely competitive, and you need to have a very clear idea of the
        niche you plan to fill before taking the plunge.Writing a business plan
        is not a complicated job and it does not have to be very long. Keep it
        concise, to the point and ensure that you cover each of the following
        topics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your business name</li>
        <li>Business management: who is going to be in charge?</li>
        <li>
          Your mission statement: in one sentence, summarize the aim of your
          street food business.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your vehicle: are you going to use a stall, a cart, a trailer or a
          truck?
        </li>
        <li>
          Start-up costs: what do you need to buy to get started? What fees to
          you need to pay in advance?
        </li>
        <li>
          The daily operational costs: how much will you spend on ingredients
          and what are the overhead costs on a weekly or monthly basis?
        </li>
        <li>
          Funding and financial projections; where do you plan to get the money
          from to start the business and what are your projected profits/losses
          for the next month, year, 2 years etc? How will you maintain the
          cash-flow?
        </li>
        <li>
          Your schedule: will you work on the business full-time or alongside
          your day job?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is your main competition and how will you differentiate yourself
          from it?
        </li>
        <li>What is your marketing strategy?</li>
        <li>
          Do you have the logistics in place to deal with delivery and customer
          service?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you plan to focus on events, your food cart business plan should
        include a clear targeting strategy. Pitch fees will vary widely, and
        there are a whole host of other variables to consider including total
        attendance, other traders present, and the demographic of customer that
        will attend.A good idea would be to create a spreadsheet with all the
        events and street food opportunities in your area. The number of options
        available could seem daunting in the beginning, so start by thinking
        about what kind of event or environment you would expect to see a street
        food business like yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step would be to attend a few events yourself, taking note of
        the businesses that appear to be doing well and why.As a general guide,
        generic fast-food businesses that focus on sales volume fare well at
        large music festivals and other events where the food is incidental to
        the main experience, whilst high-end street food traders perform better
        at events in which the customer will be searching for a new taste
        experience. However, all the preparation in the world can not account
        for the unexpected, and you will find some events simply fail to produce
        the expected revenue. Your business plan should account for this, and
        you should always have enough spare cash in reserve to act as a safety
        net when you run up against the worst-case scenario.Your approach to
        branding and marketing is a vital part of your business plan. A strong
        brand will help you stand out from the crowd, which is important for
        attracting customers as well as for securing spots at venues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: you are often selling a lifestyle with street food, so your
        brand should have a good slogan and a clear identity which reflects
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social media should obviously be central to your marketing plan and a
        strong Facebook and Instagram presence will help you raise your profile
        and create an army of online followers who you can spread your message
        to.Regularly update your profiles with good quality photos as they
        generate a lot of interest and always display your social media handles
        so your customers /potential customers can connect with you
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step 6: Estimating Costs: How Much Does It Cost to Start and Run a Food
        Cart Business?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is no set formula for determining how much starting a street food
        business is going to cost you since the niche is very broad and there
        are too many possibilities. But even so, if you were to estimate, here
        is a general expense breakdown:
