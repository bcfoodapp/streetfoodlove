Hello, and thanks for choosing to participate in our usability test! Since we don't own a domain, we are using a self-signed certificate and your browser will warn you of this. Here are the 3 steps to access StreetFoodLove.

1. Go to https://ec2-35-161-46-59.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.
2. Ignore the security warning by opening the "advanced" text and clicking on "continue". Here are screenshots for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox showing you how to do this.
  - This is the only time you should ignore this warning. You should never accept self-signed certificates from any website.
